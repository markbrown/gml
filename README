GML: an extended Scala example

This project contains an extended example of programming in Scala
<http://www.scala-lang.org/>.  The program implements a simple language
for ray tracing named GML.  Users write GML code that produces a scene
description, which is then rendered to an output file.  The task originally
appeared as a challenge for the Third Annual ICFP Programming Contest
<http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/> in August, 2000.

	Tutorial/walkthrough (html, single-page html, pdf).

examples:
	Example GML programs.

src:
	GML implementation.


The program and documentation can be built using ant.  Before doing this,
Scala's installed location must be set in the build.properties file.  Scala
version 2.7.x is required to build the program.  Building the documentation
requires pdflatex (for pdf) or hevea (for html).

After building, GML programs can be run with a command like:

    $ scala -cp build/classes compiler.Main examples/chess.gml

which will create the chess.ppm file in the current directory.


Enjoy!
