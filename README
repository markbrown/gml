GML: an extended Scala example

This project contains an extended example of programming in Scala
<http://www.scala-lang.org/>.  The program implements a simple language
for ray tracing named GML.  Users write GML code that produces a scene
description, which is then rendered to an output file.  The task originally
appeared as a challenge for the Third Annual ICFP Programming Contest
<http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/> in August, 2000.
